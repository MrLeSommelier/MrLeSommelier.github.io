    <h1>Things you should know</h1>
    Doesn't matter, what ever happens betwen us, how long we've been apart, where ever we are, how long we haven't spoke, laugh or even seen each other. 
    You should know, for as long as I exist you will always be loved.
    And if you need anything, anytime I'll be there for you, just, leave your pride, your ego or whatever it is and call if you need anything. I'll be there as soon as I can.
    I'm just a phone call away...
